*Abstract — Although Q-Learning is considered the standard in
Machine Learning and games, it may not be the best practice in
complex cases where the state and action spaces are very large.
One popular solution is to go deep and incorporate a Neural
Network architecture into the Q-Learning algorithm as an ap-
proximation model. In this work, we replicate the paper ”A Deep
Q-Learning Based Approach Applied to the Snake Game” by Sebastianelli et al. where
the Q-values for the snake are predicted with a Deep Q-Network.
To expand upon this Deep Q-Network model, this report will also
present work on replicating the paper ”Uncertainty-Aware Action
Advising for Deep Reinforcement Learning Agents” by Da Silva et al. By asking for
advice when the uncertainty is deemed high, the resulting snake
game is able to offer a solution to the exploration-exploitation
trade-off problem while being more efficient than Q-tables. The
successful training results of both Deep Q-Network and Action
Advising models are explored and compared to the baseline
performances set out by their respective original works.*
